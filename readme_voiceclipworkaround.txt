Voice Clip Importing Workaround
for Wrapper: Offline 1.2.3 Final Build (Build 72)
version dated July 8, 2021
by KrisAnimate

To install this voice clip workaround:
Extract the contents of this .zip file to a temporary folder.
Copy the folder's contents to the folder where you installed Wrapper Offline 1.2.3 final build, overwriting any existing files.
You might want to make a backup of your existing import.bat, start_wrapper.bat, and the wrapper\tts folder first.

To use this voice clip workaround:
Use the new import.bat to import the voice clip you want to import.
There are now 2 slots available. In this version, the Import voice is now under Any Language. Import Slot 1 is under Male, and
Import Slot 2 is under Female.
To change the voice clip retrieved by any of the 2 import slots, repeat the entire importing process.
